> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [X] Description of how you will use each technology
- [X] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

*Digital Dragons* is a simple game for one or more players. It is meant to be able to help the players collaboratively tell a story together similar to popular Tabletop Role-Playing Games such as *Dungeons & Dragons*. It will keep track of and share player information including character state and anything the players do. It will also share information on the game and story when neccesary through maps, images, and text descriptions. 

### Design

Following is a sequence diagram showing how Players interact with the game and eachother.

```

### Key features

- Ability to make and join a game
- Ability to Name and make some character build choices
- Enables text based communication between players
- Keeps track of damage dealt to and by the player characters
- Constantly displays Player Health and resources
- Saves game and player roles for future sessions

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application for four HTML pages. One for login, one for Joining/Creating a game, one for creating a character, and another for playing the game
- **CSS** - Implementation of styling that works on different screen sizes and uses good color and contrast.
- **React** - Provides the interactive portions of the game interface including joining/making the game, action selection, and communication. It will also display shared elements such as health, maps, and story descriptions. It will update these elements as choices are made.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - Making and Joining games.
  - Creating and collecting character information.
  - Retriving current game data such as health, maps, and story text.
  - Submitting player actions and text messages.
  - Handling player actions including text messages and attack actions.
  - Register, login, and logout users.
- **DB/Login** - Store authentication information, and user accounts. Keeps game information including player characters, health, and recent story events.
- **WebSocket** - As each player performs an action that action is displayed to all other players in that game.
